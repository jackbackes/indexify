    Instructions:

    Before running this example, go through the following steps:

    First, go to the [Developing Indexify](https://getindexify.ai/develop/) page and follow the instructions
    to set up a local Indexify service.

    When that is complete, run `make local-dev-tls-insecure` in the root of the repo. That
    will create a self-signed certificate and keys for both the client and server, at ./.dev-tls/*.

    Ensure the TLS settings are set up correctly in local_server_config.yaml, and set the following
    environment variables:

    INDEXIFY_CERT_PATH=/path/to/repo/.dev-tls/client.crt
    INDEXIFY_KEY_PATH=/path/to/repo/.dev-tls/client.key
    INDEXIFY_CA_PATH=/path/to/repo/.dev-tls/ca.crt

    If the custom CA is not set, the client will use the system CA bundle, which may not be what you want.
